Light close to UV in the electromagnetic spectrum passes through the glass almost unhindered then is absorbed by the wall that then re-radiates in the far infrared spectrum which does not pass back through the glass easily, hence heating the inside of the building. Trombe walls are commonly used to absorb heat during sunlit hours of winter then slowly release the heat over night.</p><em>Learn more at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombe_wall'>Wikipedia</a> </em>",
